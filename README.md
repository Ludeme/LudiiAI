# Ludii AI Source Code

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Ludeme/LudiiAI)](LICENSE)
[![release-version](https://img.shields.io/github/release-pre/Ludeme/LudiiAI)](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiAI/releases)

This repository contains the source code for the built-in AIs of the [Ludii general game system](https://ludii.games/),
as well some of the AI code used for some of the [Digital Ludeme Project publications](http://www.ludeme.eu/outputs/) 
(specifically for the ones that focus on AI playing and/or training).

Note that this source code on its own cannot be directly compiled and/or run; these files import various core Ludii
classes for which source code is not included. The `.class` files for all of these are included in the main
[Ludii JAR download](https://ludii.games/download.php). We do hope that this AI source code may be useful for:

1. Clarifying any implementation details / providing a reference implementation for some of our AI publications.
2. Providing more sophisticated and advanced examples for AI implementations that can be used in Ludii (for 
simple examples, we refer to the dedicated [Ludii Example AI repository](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiExampleAI)
and the [Ludii tutorials](https://ludiitutorials.readthedocs.io)).

## Included AI Algorithms

The following AI algorithms are included:
- **Random**.
- **Flat Monte-Carlo search**.
- **Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**, with various options for customisation. This includes a standard UCT,
a PUCT selection phase (as in AlphaZero, albeit with a simpler function approximator for the policy, 
and no value head), GRAVE, tree reuse, etc.
- **Alpha-Beta Search**, with iterative deepening and options for various heuristics. Uses a paranoid
search in games with more than two players, and re-starts with a Max<sup>N</sup> search if there is
still time left and the paranoid search was run to completion.
- **Ludii AI**: an agent that uses hints written in the metadata of game files to automatically select
the "best" agent from all the above (based on our own experiments) for the current game and options.

The features and Biased MCTS described in this paper are implemented in the [Features](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiAI/tree/master/Features)
and [AI](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiAI/tree/master/AI) modules, respectively. Note that the feature discovery and training process
are not yet fully included; we hope to move those over into these modules at a later date.
